Development
-----------
We are always keen for help developing this service. Check out our [issues](https://github.com/BYOND/packaging-jenkins/issues) and see if there is anything you can implement. In general you will need access to some kind of kubernetes cluster with a [Storage Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) to provide a space for Jenkins persistent configuration.
